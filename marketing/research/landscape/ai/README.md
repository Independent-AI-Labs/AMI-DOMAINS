## Folder Layout

- `overview/` – high-level market framing, segmentation logic, and research scope.
- `segments/` – detailed breakdowns of each market positioning archetype with exemplar vendors.
- `business-models/` – cross-cutting analysis of pricing, packaging, and go-to-market levers used across segments.
- `downloads/` – supporting collateral (PDF, HTML) captured during desk research.
- `notes/` – open questions, backlog items, and interview targets.

## How to Use

1. Read `overview/market-positioning-map.md` to understand the segmentation logic.
2. Dive into relevant `segments/*.md` briefs for category-level messaging cues, strengths, and risks.
3. Reference `business-models/index.md` when tailoring pricing/packaging conversations.
