# Market Positioning Map for AI Platforms

This map classifies AI platforms by two axes that consistently appear in practitioner and analyst research:

- **Scope of capability** – whether the platform spans end-to-end horizontal workloads or focuses on depth in a narrow domain.
- **Delivery/control model** – how much of the AI stack the vendor operates and monetizes (infrastructure, platform, application, services).

| Quadrant | Positioning Archetype | Primary Buyers | Key Differentiators | Representative Vendors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Broad scope + vendor-operated stack | Hyperscaler cloud AI platforms | CIO, head of platform engineering | Elastic compute, integrated data services, governance, global scale | AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud | 
| Broad scope + tooling layer | Horizontal enterprise AI suites | Chief data officer, LOB executives | Curated model catalogs, workflow orchestration, compliance tooling | IBM watsonx, Snowflake Cortex, Databricks, DataRobot, Dataiku |
| Targeted scope + vendor-operated stack | Vertical/sector-specific AI platforms | Business unit leaders, domain SMEs | Embedded domain data, regulatory assurances, turnkey workflows | Siemens Industrial Copilot, Palantir AIP, Aidoc (healthcare), nPlan (construction) |
| Targeted scope + tooling layer | Functional/niche specialists | Heads of marketing/finance/ops, feature teams | Best-in-class UX for a single job-to-be-done, pre-trained task models | Jasper (marketing), Abnormal Security (email security), Kensho (finance), LegalMation (legal ops) |

## Segment Hierarchy

1. **Foundational infrastructure owners**
   - Hyperscalers and GPU clouds
   - Edge and on-device platform providers
2. **AI platform suites**
   - Model lifecycle & MLOps platforms
   - Data-centric AI toolchains
   - Foundation model providers / API-first platforms
3. **Verticalized AI products**
   - Industry-specific operational AI
   - Regulated markets (healthcare, finance, public sector)
   - SME-focused vertical SaaS with AI-native features
4. **Niche & functional specialists**
   - Workflow co-pilots (sales, service, HR, product)
   - Security & risk intelligence platforms
   - Creative, marketing, and design studios
   - Developer tooling (code generation, testing, observability)
5. **Ecosystem enablers**
   - Model marketplaces & hubs
   - Data providers & synthetic data platforms
   - Compliance, governance, and auditing services

Each segment entry in `../segments` elaborates on positioning statements, customer pains solved, and go-to-market momentum signals.

## Research Scope & Criteria

- **Platform definition** – vendors offering programmable AI capabilities (models, APIs, workflows) rather than single-usepoint chatbots.
- **Positioning signals tracked**
  - Target customer identity & language on public site
  - Value propositions, proof points, and analyst coverage
  - Pricing transparency and monetization mechanics
  - Ecosystem posture (partnerships, marketplaces, open-source involvement)
- **Exclusions** – agencies/consultancies without durable product IP, pure hardware makers without software platform, and non-AI analytics vendors.

## Next Research Actions

- Validate the taxonomy with revenue and funding data (Crunchbase, PitchBook, CB Insights).
- Map regulatory obligations per sector (EU AI Act risk tiers, US FDA SaMD, financial compliance regimes).
- Align internal messaging pillars to the segments with highest TAM overlap.
