# Taxonomy & Definitions

This taxonomy normalizes terminology used across analyst firms, investors, and vendor marketing when discussing AI platform positioning. Use these definitions for consistent messaging and competitor tagging.

## 1. Infrastructure-Led Platforms

**Hyperscalers** – Cloud providers bundling compute, storage, networking, foundation models, and managed MLOps (e.g., AWS Bedrock + SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure AI). Positioning emphasizes trust, enterprise readiness, hybrid deployment, and wide partner ecosystems.

**Specialized GPU/accelerator clouds** – Providers differentiating on access to GPUs, accelerators, and model training efficiency (CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, RunPod, Vultr). Their positioning targets AI startups and research teams needing elastic training capacity.

**Edge/on-device AI platforms** – Infrastructure and SDKs to run models on constrained devices (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm AI Stack, Apple Core ML, Edge Impulse). Messaging centers on latency, privacy, and ruggedized deployments.

## 2. Horizontal AI Application Platforms

**Enterprise AI suites** – Integrated environments for data prep, model training, deployment, and governance. Often sold to multinational enterprises with existing data teams. Examples: Databricks, Snowflake Cortex, IBM watsonx, SAS Viya, Oracle Data Science.

**Foundation model/API platforms** – Model providers exposing hosted LLMs and multimodal models via APIs or managed instances (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral, AI21 Labs). Differentiation includes model quality, safety guardrails, latency, geographic availability, and enterprise support tiers.

**Productivity & collaboration co-pilots** – Platforms embedded across office suites or developer workflows (Microsoft Copilot, Google Workspace Duet, GitHub Copilot, Notion AI). Positioning leans on productivity metrics, integration depth, and user adoption.

## 3. Vertical & Domain-Specific Platforms

**Industry operations platforms** – Turnkey AI for manufacturing, energy, logistics, agriculture. Examples: C3.ai (energy), Uptake (industrial), Samsara (fleets), Prospera (agtech). Messaging focuses on ROI, asset uptime, and safety compliance.

**Healthcare & life sciences AI** – Regulated solutions for diagnostics, patient triage, genomic insights (Tempus, PathAI, Paige, Aidoc). Positioning highlights FDA clearances, real-world evidence, and integrated clinical workflows.

**Financial services & risk platforms** – AI for fraud, underwriting, trading, compliance (Zest AI, Riskified, Darktrace, Kensho). Differentiation includes explainability, regulatory compliance, and model governance.

**Public sector & defense AI** – Platforms supporting mission intelligence, command & control, or smart cities (Palantir AIP, Anduril Lattice, Helsing). Messaging emphasizes sovereign control, security accreditation, and multi-domain data fusion.

## 4. Functional & Niche Specialists

**Marketing & creative studios** – Generative AI for content, design, and campaign automation (Adobe Firefly, Jasper, Typeface, Synthesia). Positioning centers on brand safety, workflow integration, and creative control.

**Customer operations & sales** – AI for support automation, sales coaching, revenue intelligence (Gong, Chorus, Ada, Intercom Fin, Drift, Forethought). Key claims include faster resolution, pipeline coverage, and omnichannel support.

**Developer tooling & QA** – Code generation, test automation, model observability (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Replit, Trunk Check, Arize AI, WhyLabs). Differentiation spans reliability, security, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

**Security & governance** – Threat detection, policy enforcement, and AI assurance (Abnormal Security, Vectra AI, HiddenLayer, CalypsoAI). Positioning stresses zero trust, compliance posture, and AI supply chain protection.

**Data ecosystem enablers** – Synthetic data, labeling, model evaluation, and marketplaces (Scale AI, Labelbox, Snorkel AI, Mostly AI, Hugging Face, Modelscope, Azure AI Marketplace). Differentiation includes domain coverage, privacy, and open tooling.

## Usage Guidelines

- Tag competitors with the most specific applicable sub-category to avoid overlooking specialized messaging.
- When creating battlecards, mirror the language prospects already see (e.g., "co-pilot" vs "assistant").
- Track emerging categories (e.g., agentic automation platforms, retrieval infrastructure) in `notes/questions.md` for ongoing updates.
