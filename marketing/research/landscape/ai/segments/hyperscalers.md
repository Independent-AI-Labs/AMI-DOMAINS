# Hyperscaler Cloud AI Platforms

**Definition** – Full-stack cloud providers embedding AI services across compute, storage, networking, and application layers. Offer both foundational model access (first-party and partner models) and end-to-end MLOps pipelines.

## Positioning Narrative

- Promise enterprise-grade reliability, security, and geographic coverage.
- Emphasize unified data + AI story (data warehouses, lakehouses, integration tooling).
- Highlight breadth of partner ecosystem and marketplace breadth.
- Position AI as an incremental unlock on top of existing cloud workloads.

## Core Value Pillars

1. **Scalability & performance** – Elastic GPUs/TPUs, optimized inference endpoints, hybrid deployment.
2. **Trust & compliance** – Certifications, responsible AI tooling, data residency controls.
3. **Speed to value** – Pre-built solutions, reference architectures, extensive documentation.
4. **Ecosystem leverage** – ISV marketplaces, system integrator networks, co-selling programs.

## Buyer Personas

- CIO, CTO, Chief Data Officer seeking standardization across business units.
- Platform engineering leads consolidating infrastructure and AI services.
- Procurement teams negotiating enterprise agreements.

## Business & Pricing Models

- Usage-based metering (per compute hour, per request, per token).
- Tiered enterprise agreements with committed spend and discount ladders.
- Marketplace revenue share for partner solutions.
- Co-selling with professional services and global SIs to drive adoption.

## Representative Vendors

- AWS (Bedrock, SageMaker, Titan)
- Microsoft Azure (Azure AI, OpenAI Service, Copilot stack)
- Google Cloud (Vertex AI, Gemini, Model Garden)
- Alibaba Cloud (PAI, Lingjun)
- IBM Cloud + watsonx (hybrid focus)

## Competitive Considerations

- High switching costs favor incumbent hyperscaler relationships.
- Differentiation increasingly anchored in governance, industry accelerators, and partner depth.
- Pricing complexity and data egress fees can create friction for AI-native startups.

## Watchpoints

- Regulatory scrutiny on data sovereignty and AI safety obligations.
- Emergence of sovereign clouds (EU, Middle East, APAC) creating regional fragmentation.
- Specialized GPU clouds wooing AI-native builders with lower cost and faster procurement.
